# THE MISTGOS MANIFESTO

## 1. The Premise: The End of Files

Traditional operating systems are prisoners of 1970s hierarchy. Folders, file paths, and monolithic permissions are relics of a physical past. **MISTGOS** shatters these constraints.

We do not build a filesystem. We cultivate a **Space**.
In this space, there are no files—only **Nodes** and **Edges**. It is a dynamic, living graph where data and logic coexist in free yet secure entanglement. It is a non-Unix approach to digital existence.

## 2. The Architecture: GMOS

**MISTGOS** is a **GMOS** (Graph-based Modular Operating System).

* **Modular by Birth:** The system is composed of independent modules. You do not "install" software; you link a new module into your graph.

* **Headless First:** The graphical interface is an optional module. The core is pure, fast, and invisible.

* **Object-Capability Security:** Security is not a lock on a door; it is the absence of the door itself. If you do not possess a direct connection (Edge) to a node, that node functionally does not exist for you. This is **Invisibility by Design.**

## 3. The GMOS Lineage and the MISTGOS Progenitor

MISTGOS is the pioneer, the progenitor of a new breed of "GMOS-like" systems. While MISTGOS leads the way, **GMOS** represents the overarching family and lineage.

We do not gatekeep or discourage forks; we embrace them. The GMOS lineage is designed to diversify and adapt. It allows the system to be branched into infinite "Shards"—specific configurations tailored for different needs, from minimalist command-line cores to complex creative workstations.

## 4. Sovereignty and Intelligence

One of the inherent advantages of the MISTGOS architecture is its seamless compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs), as the graph-based core structure provides natural context that AI can understand.

**However, our path is not the path of the mega-corporations.** In MISTGOS, AI is a tool you may choose to invite, not a ghost that haunts your system. The OS does not need AI to be fully capable, and it will never be forced upon the user. We provide the structural capability; you retain absolute sovereignty.

## 5. Developer's Note & Status

**Current State:** Experimental / Raw / Pre-Alpha.
This project is currently the work of a **single developer**.

* **Hobbyist Roots:** The developer is testing personal visions. These ideas are experimental and may not represent industry "standard" practices.

* **AI-Assisted Development:** The developer uses AI tools to help write and refine the code.

* **Production Warning:** Use at your own risk.

> **MISTGOS is your personal digital universe. It provides the structure; you provide the intent. The power remains in your hands, hidden in the Mist until you choose otherwise.
